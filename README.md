# CWin32TextEditor
Basic text editor made with C programming language.
I used CodeBlocks IDE (MingwEdition) for this project.

For Implementation:
Just coppy header file: 
https://www.dropbox.com/s/le35pmgdz6ckh77/resource3.h?dl=0
to "Your directory"\CodeBlocks\MinGW\include\ folder.

## Project Features: 
You can save & write & read .txt file.
Coppy shorcut: Control+c
Cut shorcut: Control+x
Paste shorcut: Control+v
This editor has a scrool bar that you can change windows width and height. (Default value is 500x500) 

### Buttons : 
1th Button: "New File"  If you write some text and you want to make new file, than you should click this button without use backspace.
2nd Button: "Open"  Just open a .txt file.
3rd Button: "Save"  Save your writes in project to somewhere in your PC.
